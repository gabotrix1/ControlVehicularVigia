# Vehicle Control Vig√≠a Project

This project is intended to show you how to control connected relay switches with a Raspberry Pi using your iOS/android device or web browser, allowing you to control any hardware in the vehicle.

A relay switch (x4) on the Raspberry Pi pin connected to Firebase controlled by an app and a web client has been used in this project.


* **Fire Base**
  
     - Initializing Google Firebase.
       After creating the Firebase project in your console, you need to create an object called "Switch" that contains a "state" value between "ON/OFF"

* **Raspberry Pi - relay switch**
     - Connection of the relay switch with the Raspberry Pi.
      The circuit should be like this:

     - Initialize python program on (Raspberry Pi) connected with Firebase API to get data.

* **iOS APP**
     - Initialize the Xcode project and then connect the app with Firebase.
